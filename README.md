## Dotfiles dependencies:

# neovim
  - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) has to be installed, pretty sure some other things too but I'm too lazy to check, addons will install themselves
  - onedark.vim is the colorscheme, placed under ~/.config/neovim/colors/onedark.vim
 
# termite
  - source code pro is a must have font, get it.

# tmux
  - xclip comes in handy, as the config includes a buffer-to-clipboard bit
  - Truecolor terminal of your liking
# .vimrc
  - Truecolor terminal of your liking

# .zshrc
  - [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is mandatory for every zsh user
    - my very plagiarised theme is optional
  - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) is nice to have too.
  

Do note that all of this is practically stolen from other people :3
